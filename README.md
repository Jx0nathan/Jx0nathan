### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=Gapur.Gapur)

I’m a **Head of Technical** focused on **crypto payments, stablecoins, and financial infrastructure**.

I build systems where **money actually moves** — across cards, stablecoins, ledgers, and settlement rails — under real-world constraints like **compliance, scale, and operational risk**.


## What I Do

- 🧱 **0 → 1 Fintech & Web3 Platforms**
  - Crypto cards & card-as-a-service
  - Stablecoin acquiring, on/off-ramps, and settlement
  - End-to-end ledger, clearing & reconciliation systems
  - On-chain ↔ off-chain fund flow design

- ⚙️ **System Architecture at Scale**
  - Payment authorization, clearing & settlement
  - High-availability, cloud-native infrastructure
  - Cost-efficient platforms (25–50%+ infra cost reduction)
  - Observability, DevOps, and reliability engineering

- 🧠 **Tech Leadership & Execution**
  - Built and led engineering teams from 0 to 100+
  - Hands-on architecture + org design
  - PCI-DSS / regulatory audit readiness
  - Turning prototypes into production-grade systems
  

**What I Care About:**
- Payments that actually clear and settle (not just demos)
- Systems that survive growth, audits, and bad days
- Clean architecture over clever hacks
- Teams that can ship consistently, not heroically
