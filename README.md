### Glad to see you here!

I serve as a **CTO & Chief Architect** focused on the convergence of **crypto payments, stablecoins, and traditional financial infrastructure**.

I build systems where **money actually moves** — bridging the gap between on-chain liquidity and off-chain settlement under real-world constraints like compliance (PCI-DSS), scale, and operational risk.

### 💭 What I Care About

* Payments that actually **clear and settle** (not just demos).
* Systems that survive growth, audits, and bad days.
* **Clean architecture** over clever hacks.
* Teams that ship consistently, not heroically.
